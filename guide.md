Got it üëç You want a **WordPress theme** that mimics a Linux boot screen, then transitions into a **BSD-style boot menu with ASCII art** and options for navigating your portfolio. Since you don‚Äôt want code, I‚Äôll give you a **step-by-step guide/roadmap** to approach this.

---

## 1. **Plan the Flow**

* **Landing Page** = Boot sequence animation (fake dmesg / kernel logs scrolling).
* **Transition** = "boot complete" ‚Üí shows BSD-like boot menu.
* **Menu** = ASCII art + text menu with options like `1. Projects`, `2. About`, `3. Contact`.
* **Navigation** = Selecting an option should load the respective WordPress page.

---

## 2. **Theme Base**

* Start with a **barebones theme** (don‚Äôt use heavy prebuilt ones).

  * Use [*Underscores*](https://underscores.me/) or a very minimal starter theme.
  * This ensures you have full control over HTML/CSS/JS.

---

## 3. **Boot Screen Animation**

* Use a **full-screen black background** with monospace font (like *Courier New* or *Fira Code*).
* Fake Linux boot logs:

  * Pre-written text strings styled as kernel logs (`[ OK ]`, `Starting service`, etc.).
  * Use JavaScript to **print line by line** with slight delays ‚Üí simulates boot.
  * Optional: randomize delays for realism.
* End with `Login: root` or `Boot complete.` ‚Üí triggers transition.

---

## 4. **BSD-Style Menu**

* After the boot sequence, fade into a **text-based menu screen**:

  * Show ASCII art logo (your name / brand).
  * Below it, menu options like:

    ```
    1. Projects
    2. About Me
    3. Contact
    4. Exit
    ```
* Use **keyboard navigation** (press `1` ‚Üí go to portfolio projects page).
* Also allow mouse clicks for convenience.

---

## 5. **Page Layout**

* Keep inner pages also **terminal-inspired**:

  * Black background + green/white text.
  * Optional: add fake command prompt (`user@portfolio:~$`) on top of each section.
  * Content should "type out" instead of appearing instantly.
* Keep ASCII dividers, system info style headers, etc.

---

## 6. **WordPress Integration**

* Boot + menu = your **custom homepage (front-page.php)**.
* Each portfolio section (Projects, About, Contact) = standard WP pages.
* Use **JavaScript routing** (keypress detection) to redirect to page URLs.

---

## 7. **ASCII Artwork**

* Make ASCII art of your name/logo.
* Tools: [https://ascii-generator.site/](https://ascii-generator.site/) or `toilet` / `figlet` on Linux.
* Store ASCII inside `<pre>` blocks so formatting is preserved.

---

## 8. **Polish / Extra Ideas**

* Add **CRT scanline effect** or subtle flicker for realism.
* Add fake error messages, like:

  ```
  [FAILED] Load humor.module
  [ OK ] Portfolio service started
  ```
* Add a fake `uname -a` output with your details.
* For projects, display them as "mounted drives" or "running processes."

---

## 9. **Testing**

* Make sure:

  * Works on desktop & mobile.
  * Menu is accessible by both keyboard and touch.
  * Animation isn‚Äôt too long (give option to skip).

---

## 10. **Deployment**

* Package theme ‚Üí Upload to your WordPress.
* Set homepage ‚Üí boot simulation page.
* Done ‚úÖ

üëâ Would you like me to also **suggest a rough structure of WordPress theme files** (which files to create/edit and what goes where), so you can map the boot/menu idea into WordPress?
